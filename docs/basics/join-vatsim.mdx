    level="warning"
    message="If you have previously been a VATSIM member and your account is inactive, please do not create a new account. Instead, you can reactivate your old account by visiting myVATSIM. This will also reinstate any previous ATC rating you had and will continue to log flight statistics against previously logged stats. Members may hold only one VATSIM identification number and password."

If you're new to VATSIM, please follow the instructions on the [Sign Up](https://my.vatsim.net/register) Page. When you've completed this form you'll have to confirm your email address and will receive your account details.

## Get Started
Once you have your account details, you can get started as a pilot or a controller. To do so, we suggest you first read the Pilot's Getting Started page or find your local Region/Division websites for more information about ATC Training.

You can find all the links on this website to software you will need to connect as a Pilot or Air Traffic Controller.
