**§6.09 Formal Suspension and Expulsion Procedures/Rights of Member**

This rule sets forth the procedures to be followed prior to the imposition of a formal suspension and/or expulsion of a VATSIM.net member and the rights of a member during and after such procedures. This rule and the rights contained herein apply once a member has been temporarily suspended pursuant to the terms of Article VI., §6.06 above.

**A.** Investigation by the Divisional Conflict Resolution Manager: Pursuant to the terms of §6.06 of this Article and upon imposition of a temporary suspension, a suspended member’s case shall first be referred to the Divisional Conflict Resolution Manager for the division to which the member is assigned. In the event that the suspended member is not assigned to a specific division, then the case shall be assigned to the most appropriate Divisional Conflict Resolution Manager as selected by the Vice President of Conflict Resolution. For purposes of this Article, the Divisional Conflict Resolution Manager shall be hereinafter referred to as the “DCRM”.
  1. Initial Notification Requirements of the DCRM: The DCRM shall, upon referral of the matter, send a notice to the accused member by e-mail which notifies said member of the referral and shall include, at a minimum, the date of the referral to the DCRM, a statement advising that the accused member has ten (10) days from said referral date to submit written statements to the DCRM, a statement that the accused member has a right to request, in writing, copies of any written evidence gathered by the DCRM in the course of his or her investigation and the email address of DCRM along with a statement instructing that any written evidence must be submitted to that particular e-mail address.

This investigation shall consist of gathering written statements from the individual recommending formal suspension or expulsion and any other parties to the alleged incident, including the accused member who has the right to address the DCRM in writing. Any evidence gathered must be in written form. The accused member has the right, upon written request, to review all written documents and statements which have been gathered by the DCRM in the course of his or her investigation. The DCRM shall then review all evidence which has been gathered for the purpose of rendering a decision to either impose a formal suspension or expulsion of the accused member or to acquit such accused member of the charge(s).
  3. Extension of Temporary Suspension Period: The DCRM has the power to extend the temporary suspension period imposed under Article VI., §6.06 while he or she conducts the investigation into the alleged misconduct of the temporarily suspended member. Under no circumstances, however, shall any such extension exceed more than thirty (30) days past the date of receipt of referral of the case from the Vice President of Conflict Resolution on the VATSIM.net Board of Governors or his or her designate.
  4. Time: The DCRM must render his or her decision for a particular case within thirty(30)days of receipt of the referral of the matter. For purposes of this rule, the thirty (30) day period begins on the day of receipt of referral and includes Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. If a final decision is not rendered within the thirty (30) day time period, the case against the accused member shall be dismissed and may not be refilled under any circumstances.
  5. Accused Member’s Evidence: Any evidence which is submitted by the accused member to the DCRM must be received within ten (10) days of the date of referral. For purposes of this rule, the ten (10) day period begins on the day of receipt of referral and includes Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. The DCRM may, upon good cause shown, extend this time period.
  6. Reaching a Decision: The DCRM shall review all the evidence gathered in his or her investigation and shall then render a decision to either impose a formal suspension or expulsion of the accused member or to acquit such accused member of the charge(s). If a finding of guilty is reached, then the DCRM shall impose a penalty which shall be either a formal suspension for a fixed period of time, or permanent expulsion. If a finding of not guilty is reached, thenthe accused member shall be acquitted and full membership privileges including rating shall be immediately restored.
  7. Penalty: The DCRM has the authority to impose, in his or her sole discretion, any penalty he or she deems fit in a particular case. These penalties include, but are not limited to:
  8. Imposing a formal suspension period of any length including the time of suspension which has been served by the guilty member; or
  9. Permanently expelling the member; or
  10. Reducing the rating of the member; or
  11. Any combination of penalties.
  12. In the event of the imposition of a formal suspension, the DCRM shall give credit against the overall suspension for any days served under a temporary suspension period.
  13. Notification of Decision: The DCRM will reduce his or her decision to writing and shall provide it to the Divisional Director, the relevant Regional Vice President, the Vice President of Conflict Resolution on the VATSIM.net Board of Governors, the Vice President of Supervisors on the VATSIM.net Board of Governors,and to the member.
