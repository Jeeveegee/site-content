VATSIM is a worldwide virtual community. The Board of Governors are working internationally, currently staffed with members from across the globe.

Of course, members around the world have local groups which lead the local training, the community, and give you the local contact to hobbyists with the same hobby. Therefore, VATSIM is currently organized in three regions, which cover our virtual world. Each region is divided into different smaller organizations, called Divisions. And Divisions may hold the local member organizations such as vACCs, FIRs, or ARTCCs.
